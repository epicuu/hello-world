# hello-world

blue boy

learning python right now and hoping to improve my programming as time goes on

started with a compsci course in freshman year, got a near perfect grade and knew it was what i wanted to do

ended up taking a gamedev class and a webdesign class in sophomore year, got good grades on those

took ap compsci the next year, enjoyed it but wanted a more practical approach to learning that translates directly to the private sector

now i dont have any classes i can really take at my school pertaining to programming

so i'm self-teaching to improve and hopefully become great at programming before i even enter college

big thanks to my compsci teacher
